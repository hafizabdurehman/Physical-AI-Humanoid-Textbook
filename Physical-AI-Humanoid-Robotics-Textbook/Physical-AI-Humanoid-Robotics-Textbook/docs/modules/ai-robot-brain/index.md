### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) enables robots to learn behaviors through interaction with their environment:

- **State Space**: The robot's perception of the environment
- **Action Space**: Available actions the robot can take
- **Reward Function**: Feedback mechanism for learning
- **Policy**: Strategy for selecting actions

### Policy Learning

Policy learning involves developing strategies for robot behavior:

- **Imitation Learning**: Learning from expert demonstrations
- **Behavior Cloning**: Direct mapping from perception to action
- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning**: Learning reward functions

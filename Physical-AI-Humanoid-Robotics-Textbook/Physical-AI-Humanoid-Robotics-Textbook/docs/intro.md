# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics Education

This comprehensive textbook covers the essential concepts of **Physical AI**, **Humanoid Robotics**, and their practical applications. The content is structured to take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations using modern tools and technologies.

### Textbook Structure

The textbook is organized into several key modules:

1. **[Physical AI Foundations](./modules/physical-ai-foundations/index.md)** - Core concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
2. **[ROS 2 Nervous System](./modules/ros2-nervous-system/index.md)** - Communication architecture for robotics applications
3. **[Digital Twin Simulation](./modules/digital-twin/index.md)** - Gazebo and Unity workflows for robotics
4. **[AI-Robot Brain](./modules/ai-robot-brain/index.md)** - NVIDIA Isaac for intelligent robot control
5. **[Vision-Language-Action Systems](./modules/vision-language-action/index.md)** - Cognitive planning and interaction

### Learning Approach

This textbook follows a progressive learning approach:

- **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding core concepts before practical application
- **Simulation-First**: All examples are reproducible in simulation environments
- **Academic Rigor**: Proper citations and peer-reviewed sources
- **Practical Application**: Laboratory exercises and capstone project

### Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Students of AI, robotics, mechatronics, and computer engineering
- Educators building lab courses or simulations
- Developers learning ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA systems
- Beginner to advanced learners in robotics

### Technical Requirements

All examples in this textbook:
- Run in simulation environments only (no hardware manipulation)
- Use open-source tools and frameworks
- Are reproducible with proper documentation
- Meet academic standards with APA citations

### Capstone Project

The textbook culminates in a capstone project: **[Voice-to-Action Capstone](./capstone/voice-to-action-capstone.md)** where you'll implement a simulated humanoid robot that responds to voice commands.

### Laboratory Exercises

Each module includes hands-on laboratory exercises:
- [ROS 2 Labs](./labs/ros2-labs.md)
- [Digital Twin Labs](./labs/digital-twin-labs.md)
- [Isaac Labs](./labs/isaac-labs.md)
- [VLA Labs](./labs/vla-labs.md)

### Academic Standards

This textbook maintains high academic standards:
- ≥15 credible sources with ≥50% peer-reviewed
- APA 7th edition citations
- Zero plagiarism tolerance
- Proper attribution and original analysis

### Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate through the textbook content. Each module is designed to be independently learnable while building upon previous concepts.

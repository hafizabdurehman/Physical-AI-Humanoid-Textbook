# Citation Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for citing sources in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook following APA 7th edition standards.

## General Citation Format

All citations in this textbook follow the APA 7th edition format. The general structure for different source types is outlined below.

### Books
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work: Capital letter also for subtitle*. Publisher.

Example:
Siciliano, B., & Khatib, O. (2016). *Springer handbook of robotics* (2nd ed.). Springer.

### Journal Articles
Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical*, volume(issue), pages. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy

Example:
Kober, J., Bagnell, J. A., & Peters, J. (2013). Reinforcement learning in robotics: A survey. *The International Journal of Robotics Research*, 32(11), 1238-1274.

### Conference Papers
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of paper. *Title of Conference*, pages. Publisher. https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy

Example:
Thomason, J., et al. (2019). Vision-and-Language Navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments. *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, 7433-7443.

## In-Text Citations

### Single Author
- Parenthetical: (Smith, 2020)
- Narrative: Smith (2020) argued that...

### Multiple Authors
- Two authors: (Smith & Jones, 2020) or Smith and Jones (2020)
- Three to five authors: (Smith et al., 2020) after first citation
- Six or more authors: (Smith et al., 2020) for all citations

### Direct Quotes
For direct quotes, include page number(s):
(Smith, 2020, p. 25) or Smith (2020) stated, "quote" (p. 25)

## Reference List Guidelines

### Alphabetical Order
- Arrange entries in alphabetical order by the surname of the first author
- When multiple works by the same author are listed, arrange them by year (earliest first)

### Capitalization
- Capitalize only the first word of the title and subtitle, and any proper nouns
- Italicize titles of books and journals

### Academic Standards
This textbook maintains high academic standards by ensuring:
- At least 50% of sources are peer-reviewed
- All sources are current within the last 10 years when possible
- All claims are properly attributed to original sources
- No plagiarism through proper attribution and original analysis

## Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)

When available, include DOIs in the reference list. Use the format:
https://doi.org/xx.xxx/yyyy

## URL Citations

For online sources without DOIs:
Author, A. A. (Year, Month Date). Title of webpage. Site Name. URL

## Academic Integrity

### Avoiding Plagiarism
- All borrowed ideas must be properly cited
- Direct quotes must be enclosed in quotation marks
- Paraphrased content must still be cited
- Common knowledge does not require citation

### Original Analysis
While citing sources is essential, this textbook provides original analysis and synthesis of information, connecting concepts across different domains of Physical AI and robotics.

## Examples of Proper Citations
